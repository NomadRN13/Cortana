-- 40/LOVE — gender identity + dating preference matching
-- Adds who-I-am and who-I'm-looking-to-date to profiles, and makes the
-- Date-mode deck a MUTUAL filter: you see only people who fit what you're
-- looking for AND who are looking for someone like you. All pairings are
-- first-class: woman↔man, woman↔woman, man↔man, and nonbinary in any
-- combination. Play and Friends modes are unaffected — those are for
-- everyone regardless of dating preference.

create type public.gender_identity as enum ('woman', 'man', 'nonbinary');

alter table public.profiles
  add column gender public.gender_identity,
  add column seeking public.gender_identity[] not null default '{}';

-- Date-mode deck now requires the mutual gender fit. Profiles that haven't
-- set gender/seeking simply don't appear in (or see) the Date deck until
-- they do — Play/Friends keep working for them.
