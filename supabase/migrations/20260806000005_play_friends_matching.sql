-- 40/LOVE — Play-mode game matching + Friends-mode preference
-- Play mode: players say which game types they want (singles, doubles,
-- mixed doubles) and, for singles/doubles, whether they want to play with
-- women, men, or everyone. The deck shows only compatible players: a shared
-- game type, with the gender preference honored MUTUALLY — unless the
-- shared game is mixed doubles, which is open by nature. Friends mode gets
-- the same women/men/everyone preference, also mutual. Defaults are fully
-- open (all games, everyone), so nobody is filtered until they choose to be.
