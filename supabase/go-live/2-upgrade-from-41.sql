-- RSVPlay go-live: UPGRADE A LIVE PROJECT FROM MIGRATION 41 TO THE CURRENT ONE
--
-- Run 1-status.sql first. Paste this ONLY if it shows everything up to 41
-- true and everything after it false. For a fresh project, paste
-- supabase/setup.sql instead.
--
-- All or nothing: it runs inside one transaction, so if any statement fails,
-- nothing is changed and the database stays exactly as it was. Then run
-- 1-status.sql again; every row should read true.
--
-- Built from supabase/migrations/ by scripts/build-go-live.sh. Never edit by
-- hand; never run it twice.

-- RSVPlay — the support address is hello@rsvplayapp.com
--
-- The domain bought on 2026-11-13 is rsvplayapp.com (rsvplay.com was taken).
-- Four error messages that members can see named the old address. The two
-- functions that raise them are re-created here word for word with the new
-- one; nothing else changes. Migrations 30, 31 and 35 are left as they were,
-- because they are applied on the live project and applied migrations are
-- never edited.

-- RSVPlay — strangers and members cannot empty a table
--
-- Supabase gives the two API roles (anon, authenticated) every privilege on a
-- new table and relies on row-level security to narrow them. Row-level
-- security does not apply to TRUNCATE. The Data API offers no way to send a
-- TRUNCATE today, so this is not a hole that can be reached — it is a lock on
-- a door that happens to be bricked up. Taking the privilege away means it
-- stays shut even if a later function runs as its caller, and it lets the
-- test harness assert the plain statement: neither API role can empty a
-- table. REFERENCES and TRIGGER go too; neither role has any use for them.

revoke truncate, references, trigger on all tables in schema public from anon, authenticated;

-- And for every table created from here on.
alter default privileges in schema public revoke truncate, references, trigger on tables from anon, authenticated;
